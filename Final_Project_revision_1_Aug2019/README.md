# project_movie_genre
Final Bootcamp project

### Overview
The goal was to predict the sentiment and genre of a movie based on a movieâ€™s plot and review. We used machine learning, Scikit Learn to build a model that would predict the genre based on the movie plot and integrated it with web scraping APIs from the IMDB and New York Time websites.

### Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.  You will need to get an API Key from the OMDB site as well as one from the New York Time in order do make the webscrapping and app work correctly.

### Prerequisites

The following requirements were used in the running of the app.  Also needed to run the app.py in Git Bash or Command vs the terminal in the environment that I was running in.  Provided below is the Python version we created the app in .  The website is built using Bootstrap in the recent version and was intially created through Bootstrapmade.  We are using Mongo dB to store all the data from the API and webscraping.

### Installing

To run the code, you will download the various files and run the app.py to get the Flask app running.  We ran it in terminal using Visual Studio code without any issues.  Once that is up and running, then go to your local host and the template and .js code should be working from the template and js folders.  In this program we are using Mongo dB, so you want to make sure that is available on your maching.

The key programs for running the application are:
* app.py
* templates folder 
* static folder and subfolders
* scrape_nyt.py
* movie_genretranformpredict.sav
* movie_genrepredict.sav
* move_genreyvaluepredict.sav

The remaining files are support to the creation of the model and the application.

### Built With

* Python [3.7.1]
* Jupyter [5.7.4]
* Mongo dB
* Bootstrap / Bootstrapmade
* Beautifulsoup
* NLTK
* Vader
* Other libraries located in the app.py
